# Houses Pricing Analysis

Explore and analyze house pricing data to extract trends and build predictive models. This notebook includes data visualization, feature analysis, and regression modeling.

## What I Did

- Acquired a housing dataset with attributes like price, location, size, and other relevant features.
- Performed an initial analysis to understand data distribution and identify outliers.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and important factors influencing prices.
- Engineered new features to enhance predictive power.
- Built regression models (such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor) to predict house prices.
- Evaluated model predictions using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
- Visualized feature importance and model predictions.
- Summarized findings and suggested factors that most affect house prices.
- Cleaning Data Loading from Kaggle
- Data Cleaning Split Column - Replace values - Save Data to CSV
- Univariate Analysis Matplotlib Subplots
- Bivariate Analysis Feature and Target Parameters - Correlations - seaborn pairplot
- What has a greater influence on the price of an apartment, the area or the location?
- Linear Regression Model to predict the price of a flat 
- Multi linear regression to predict the price of a flat
- What if we want to infer using text data (Dummy variables)
## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
