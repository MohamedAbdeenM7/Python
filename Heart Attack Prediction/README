# Heart Attack Prediction

This project predicts the risk of a heart attack using clinical and personal data. It covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## What I Did

- Obtained a heart disease dataset containing clinical parameters and patient information.
- Explored the dataset to understand the attributes and their correlation with heart attack risk.
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features where necessary.
- Selected important features using correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
- Built and trained multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Assessed model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
- Interpreted feature importance and model outputs to provide actionable health insights.
- Documented the full workflow for clarity and reproducibility.
