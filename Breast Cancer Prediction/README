# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on input data. The notebook walks through the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing data, training classification models, evaluating results, and visualizing performance.

## What I Did

- Researched and obtained a publicly available breast cancer dataset (typically from UCI or Kaggle).
- Loaded and explored the data to understand its structure, features, and target labels.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Performed feature selection to identify the most relevant attributes for prediction.
- Built and trained multiple classification models (such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest).
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
- Visualized the results to compare model effectiveness and interpret key findings.
- Documented the workflow and insights for reproducibility.

## Features
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run each cell in order.
3. Modify the dataset path if necessary.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Results
