## What I Did

- Collected or sourced sales data for various products from a food company (real or simulated dataset).
- Loaded the data into a Jupyter Notebook and performed an initial exploration to understand its structure.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends, best-selling products, and seasonal effects.
