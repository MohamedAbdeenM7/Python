# Plants Classification

Classify plant species using machine learning and possibly image processing techniques. The notebook guides users through dataset handling, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation.

## What I Did

- Gathered a dataset of plant images or tabular features (such as leaf shape, color, or texture).
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the nature of the features and targets.
- Preprocessed the data, including resizing images (if required) and normalizing feature values.
- Engineered or extracted relevant features for classification.
- Built and trained supervised learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, or Convolutional Neural Networks for images).
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics.
- Visualized predictions and misclassifications for further insight.
- Provided comprehensive documentation of the process and results.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run each cell as instructed.
3. Modify paths to data as required.

## Requirements
